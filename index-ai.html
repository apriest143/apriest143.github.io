        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <img class="headshot" src="images/headshot.JPG" alt="Andrew Priest">
        <p>Hello! My name is Andrew Priest, and I am 21 years old. I was born and raised in Portland, Oregon which instilled a strong love of the outdoors, sports, and good food from a young age. I was a very active child, and during my youth I was either playing outside or playing hockey, soccer, or lacrosse (Depending on the season). I went to Catlin Gabel for my middle and highschool years where I made a whole bunch of lifelong friends and learned from passtionate and inspiring teachers. Eventually, it became time to "leave the nest" and go off to college. After an interesting couple of pandemic years, I had decided that I should go try living on the east coast, a decision that would land me at Babson college.</p>
        <p>I also chose <a href="https://www.babson.edu/" target ="_blank">Babson</a> because of the colleges diversity of education. I knew I wanted to do 
          something in the world of business, but had no clue what that would be. Babson provided
          me the ability to "test the waters" on a bunch of different sectors.  Before I had gone
          to Babson I believed I wanted to be in econ or finance, but after my first semester I
          knew that was not the path for me. Additionally, coming from a small highschool, the lack of large lectures and close relationship with professors was something that really stood out to me. It was a tough transition, knowing nobody before I came out here, but I quickly made some really good friends and eventually found a subject that I had some aptitude and enjoyment in. I really enjoy stats and coding so I naturally fell into business analytics and while I have no job lined up at this point, that is what I hope to continue doing after I graduate.

        <h2>My Interests</h2>
        <p>My main hobby at the moment is <strong>rock climbing</strong>. I only started about 5 months ago, but it has
          quickly become my favorite pass time. As someone who values exercise a lot I really apreciate 
          the mental puzzle aspect of climbing alongside its significant physical requirements. Unfortunately I dislocated my shoulder a few months back while climbing. It was not a very pleasant experience, and I will have to treat it carefully for a long while, watching my posture and refraining from quite a few movements. However, I have since returned to the wall and have slowly begun getting my strength back and being more comfortable, even though it may be a long while until im climbing anything significant.</p>

          <p>I am also a huge NBA fan, and love to watch, discuss, and learn about basketball. I think one of the major appeals to me is the interesting statistics and advanced models that fans and executives alike use to analyze player effectiveness. I might just be the biggest <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIsTm0lGzY4" target= "_blank"> Lebron James</a> fan in the entirety of Babson College. He genuinely is a great role model, and someone who I try to emulate in many ways. When I have spare time, I love playing basketball with my friends, and not to brag but I am kind of a knockdown shooter.
