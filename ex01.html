    <p>I chose Babson because of the colleges diversity of education. I knew I wanted to do
    something in the world of business, but had no clue what that would be. Babson provided
    me the ability to "test the waters" on a bunch of different sectors. Before I had gone
    to Babson I believed I wanted to be in econ or finance, but after my first semester I
    knew that was not the path for me. I really enjoy stats and coding so I naturally fell 
    into business analytics and that is what I hope to continue doing after I graduate.

<p>My main hobby at the moment is <strong>rock climbing</strong>. I only started about 5 months ago, but it has
quickly become my favorite passtime. As someone who values exercise a lot I really apreciate 
the mental puzzle aspect of climbing. Unfortunately I dislocated my shoulder a few months back
while climbing, but I have since returned to the wall and have slowly begun getting my strength
back and being more comfortable.
