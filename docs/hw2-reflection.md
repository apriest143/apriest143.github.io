Development Reflection (Your own coding experience):
Briefly describe your overall approach and strategy when developing each page.
    Explain clearly at least two challenges you faced during coding and how you solved them.
    Clearly state at least two new insights or skills you learned during your manual coding process (not including AI usage).
    I really liked the look and layout of the ai version of my index.html page, so my goal was to leverage the existing styles, and use that backbone alongside differing css grids to deliver the neccesary content for each page. I loved how the header and navbar looked, so it was primarily just focusing on what came after those two aspects of each page. 
    One challenge I had was keeping the same section look, but translating it into different grids. The index-ai.html was set with two sections stacked on top of each other, but for my contact page I wanted two side by side, and for my projects page I needed a 3x3. This led me to create section2 and section3 which could be placed in div containers. I had to adjust the widths of these sections on my stylesheet and place multiple containers to achieve the desired affect. In this process I better learned how a style sheet could be be filled with multiple similar elements that could be called based on their own div containers and specific requirements that each page needed. 
    I also struggled with adding different hover/interaction effects for my contact and projects page. I was able to take some code from previous sessions in order to fill out my contact page, but that was the only way I knew how to accomplish this. This was actually quite easy to fix, once I did some research and found that a background hover was quite easy to implement. This led to me adding a simple hover element to my stylesheet for section3. This showed me that even if something is unknown to me, some quick research can often find a much simpler solution than expected.

AI Interaction Log:
AI Tool(s) Used: Mention which AI tools you used and for what purposes.
AI was used quite sparingly for this assignment, I only used ChatGPT and purely for one prompt.

AI Prompts: List the specific prompts you provided clearly.
"Based on this webpage, please create a style sheet that I can use to keep other pages consistent in style"
I then sent my index-ai code to Chat in order for it to replicate my code with a style sheet.

Original AI-generated code: Include AI-generated code snippets clearly.
Attached in screenshots folder

Your modifications: Clearly indicate your modifications to AI-generated code, briefly explaining your reasoning.
I did not modify the code given to me from the AI, rather just adjusted the old pages to fit better with the stylings. I did add on to the AI code with section2 and section3 as well as adding the hover element for section3

Screenshots: Include screenshots of your AI conversations or prompts clearly demonstrating your interaction. Store these screenshots in docs/screenshots folder.
Comparative Analysis:
Clearly list at least two strengths and two weaknesses of the AI-generated solutions compared to your manual solutions.
For my AI usage, it was certianly quicker in terms of generation and creating a stylesheet that could overlap with my other pages. However, it added in some work too because the AI did not know the strucure of my other pages meaning I had to manually adjust them to fit with the stylesheet after its creation.

Describe specifically how and why you optimized the AI-generated code.
The AI code itself did not need much change outside of a few tweaks to the naming of its elements, but it was optimized through adding functionality with new grids and interactive elements.

Overall Reflection:
Clearly reflect on your overall experience of manually writing code and collaborating with AI. What did you find most valuable?
I found manually writing the code to be most valuable. Once the AI had given me a solid start with the style sheet I found it qite easy to just add in elements as needed and use the stylesheet as a way to format and frame my code. I was able to get a lot of the forum elements from previous classes and it was quite easy to implement them alongside the stylesheet.

Provide clear recommendations or strategies for effectively integrating AI tools into your future development workflow.
I think using AI to get a quick start and backbone for a main page is quite valuable, but it is much easier to cohesively integrate new pages manually as I had a much better idea of the overall structure than the AI did. Simply using the backbone and styles given to me made this assignment very manageable.
