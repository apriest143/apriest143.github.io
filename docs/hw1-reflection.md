For unrestricted(advanced) homepage:
    "Wow that looks great! Now I am taking off all restrictions, meaning please use all HTML and CSS techniques as you see fit. Note: please make an effort to incorpotate all original text if possible. Make this one super cool!"


2. Explain your strategy in crafting these prompts
    For the restricted AI homepage, I first sent my index code to ChatGPT and told it to simply familairize itself with my homepage. Then I sent the class topics we have learned so far (from the homework 1 information page) and told it to simply utilize any of those techniques in order to make it look cool. I wanted the AI to know what my starting point was give something cohesive
    
    For the unrestricted page I simply wanted the AI to run wild, and do whatever it thought would make the coolest webpage. I tried to be broad in hopes the AI would change the page drastically (Which it did). However, the advanced page looks substanitally worse than the restricted one and honestly, worse than the one I made.

3. Describe any follow-up interactions needed to refine the AI output
    The AI refused to incorportate my original text in both, opting to replace paragraphs with highly abridged versions. This meant I had to put my paragraphs back in manually.The restricted AI was unable able to incorporate any links to my portfolio/sitemap. I found this very interesting because it was able to put other links in fine, but for some reason not the sitemap. I believe this is because the AI recognized it as a personal link and likely was not able to store that information. 

Code Comparison
1. Compare your version with AI version(s)
    The restricted AI version kept with similar color themes and overall layout. It added visual effects like making the photo an oval, and generally just made things more distinct. It was able to keep every feature of my original file save for the link to my sitemap and the mentions of OIM3690(likely due to privacy reasons). Overall I was very impressed and liked a lot of the additions it made.

    The Unrestricted one changed a whole ton. The color scheme changed from an assortment of greens to blue yellow and black which I found particularly odd. It also changed the location of my photo, opting to place it front and center (and squash it, making me look really funny). It also removed the "Table of contents" section from the previous iterations of the website. It also made contact its own section within the page rather than just being a part of the footnote at the bottom.

2. Identify and explain at least three significant differences in approach or implementation
    1. Both versions of the AI used way more classes than I did, and modified them with cool things like :hover adding an underline to the text.
    2. The AI was able to format better with margins, padding, etc making a more legible and congruent page.
    3. The AI used much more visual distinction with the colors on the page, opting to use more contrasting colors schmes instead of just various shades of green.

3. Analyze which approaches are more effective and why
I think the restricted AI page looks fantastic, and way better than what I was able to make. However, the unrestricted page looks a bit off, and I really don't think the style fits very well. That being said it is certianly more technically advanced than mine, and might be better used for a corporate purpose or something.

4. If the enhanced AI version uses advanced features, explain how you would achieve similar results using basic elements
Despite explicit instruction to use advanced techniques,the unrestricted page did not incorporate anything from outside of our class.


Learning Reflection
1. Discuss what you learned from examining the AI's approach
I learned quite a bit from the AI, namely: The importance of clean class-based CSS styling. How pseudo-classes like :hover can improve interactivity and make for a more "alive" webpage. I also was able to see the role of consistent spacing & font choices in improving UI design.

2. Reflect on challenges you faced in your own implementation
At first I was struggling to link to elements within the page itself. I also had some issues keeping the paragraphs cohesively formatted when incorportaing the picture.

3. Describe how this experience might influence your future web development work
I hope to develop and external .css file similar to the restricted AI version and use this to make everything look great and cohesive with much less effort going forward.
